                Hello there, i'm Victor Anih...!!!

                  <p> This is a website dedicated to my tech journey and how it's been going so far. </p>
                  <p> I started this journey into tech less than two months ago, it all started when the JAMB examination body decided to play us dirty,
                    by giving we the candidates undeserving scores so then i said to myself,what then is the way foward..?? </p>
                    <p> I found my answers that same day when i had a conversion with a random tech guy who said i'd do well in coding if i ventured into it,
                        of which he also promised to be of help. We had our first lesson with HTML citing differences between elements, attributes and the likes.
                    </p>
                    <p> Then ever since my love for it became so much that no day at all passes without myself writing a random code or tweaking written ones.
                        It hasn't really been a bed of roses so far,full of rollercoasters but then again i guess that's what makes the whole experience worth it.
                    </p>

                        <p> I am also looking foward to be the best i can, 
                            i would also love to hear your story.
                    </p>
